Now that we have [Ionic and its dependencies installed](../installation), let's build our first app! This section will walk through the process of starting a new application, adding pages, navigating between those pages, and more. Let's get started!


## Starting a New Ionic 2 App

If you don't already have an app started from the [previous section](../installation), let's create a new app! Use the `start` command to initialize a new Ionic app. We specify that we want it to be an Ionic 2 app by passing in the `--v2` option.

```bash
$ ionic start MyIonic2Project tutorial --v2
```

This will pull Ionic 2 down, install [npm modules](../../resources/what-is/#npm) for the application, and get [Cordova](../../resources/what-is/#cordova) set up and ready to go.

You may have noticed that we passed in <b>tutorial</b> to the <code>ionic start</code> command. This tells Ionic to bootstrap your application using the <a href="https://github.com/driftyco/ionic2-starter-tutorial">tutorial template</a>. If you do not specify a template by running <code>ionic start MyIonic2Project --v2</code>, the <a href="https://github.com/driftyco/ionic2-starter-tabs">tabs starter</a> will be used.
</div>


## Viewing the app in a browser
Let's `cd` in to the folder that was created. To get a quick preview of your app in the browser, use the `serve` command.

```bash
$ cd MyIonic2Project/
$ ionic serve
```

You should see the welcome message shown above if everything was installed successfully.

In the next section, let's go over the project structure created by the `ionic start` command.
